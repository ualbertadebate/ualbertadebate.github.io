## FAQs

### How do I become a member?

You can become a member by going to our weekly meetings. Our main mode of communication to active members is through our Instagram page (@ualberta.debate) where you can access tournament registration forms and things like upcoming social events. 

We do offer a paid membership. You DO NOT need a membership to come to our meetings, socials, or attend events hosted by us. You DO NEED a membership to attend external tournaments, run for elections, and vote on decisions.

### Do I need any experience?

NO EXPERIENCE is required to come to a meeting! You can also join no matter what year or program you are in.

### What kind of commitment is this?

Your commitment to UADS is entirely up to you. Some members go to every tournament while others go to a few just to enjoy the social aspect. We have meetings twice a week but you are by no means required to go to both. Some of our members are there every meeting and some come once a week depending on availability.
How do tournaments work?

UADS participates in tournaments primarily in Canada, but also around the world. The most accessible ones are in the West, usually in Saskatchewan and BC (and of course Alberta!). Debaters cover most of their costs of travel and tournament registration. For tournaments like Fall Open, we often subsidize accommodation and travel. If you’re worried about booking flights or driving, don’t worry! We typically plan travel together. Tournaments are a great way to gain experience and make connections.
